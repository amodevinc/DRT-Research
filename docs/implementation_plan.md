# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Environment Setup

**Objectives:**  
- Establish the project structure, development environment, and basic tooling.
- Implement core abstractions and interfaces.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Repository Initialization:**  
   - Create a new Git repository with the proposed directory structure.
   - Initialize `README.md` and `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` (Poetry or setuptools).
   - Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests on every commit.

2. **Environment & Dependencies:**  
   - Set up a Python virtual environment.
   - Install basic dependencies: `numpy`, `pandas`, `pyyaml`/`jsonschema` (for config validation), `abc` (standard library), `pytest` for testing, and possibly `networkx` for preliminary graph operations.
   - Consider using `black`/`flake8` for code formatting and linting.

3. **Core Abstract Interfaces:**  
   - In `drt_sim/algorithms/base_interfaces/`, define abstract base classes for routing, dispatch, matching, cost functions, and user acceptance models.
   - In `drt_sim/core/`, implement `simulation_engine.py` and `event_manager.py` scaffolds:
     - `simulation_engine.py` will have a basic discrete event simulation loop interface.
     - `event_manager.py` will contain methods to schedule and process events, ensuring a clean interface for adding events later.

4. **Logging & Configuration Infrastructure:**  
   - Create `drt_sim/config/config_loader.py` to handle reading scenario configurations (YAML/JSON) and validate them with schemas.
   - Implement `logging_config.py` to configure logging across the system, supporting multiple verbosity levels.

5. **Testing Structure Setup:**
   - Add unit test scaffolds in `tests/unit/`.
   - Write basic tests to ensure the infrastructure is sound (e.g., configuration loading works, logging initialization checks).

**Deliverables by End of Phase 1:**
- A running skeleton: basic simulation loop (no logic yet), config loading, logging, and abstract interfaces tested by simple unit tests.

## Phase 2: Core Simulation Mechanics & State Management

**Objectives:**  
- Implement the fundamental simulation capabilities: event scheduling, state tracking of vehicles and requests.
- Integrate a simple network and routing component (e.g., a static shortest path).

**Key Steps:**
1. **State Management & Event Flow:**
   - In `drt_sim/core/state_management.py`, implement classes for tracking vehicles (position, availability), active requests, and system time.
   - Ensure simulation events (arrival of a request, vehicle reaching a stop, dispatch decisions) can be created and consumed by the simulation engine.

2. **Simple Network Integration:**
   - In `drt_sim/network/network_loader.py`, load a small test network (e.g., a simple graph from a file).
   - In `drt_sim/network/graph_operations.py`, implement a basic Dijkstra shortest path solution to allow distance/time queries.

3. **Minimal Scenario Execution:**
   - Create a basic scenario definition (`scenario_definitions.py`), including a single fleet with a couple of vehicles and a small set of requests.
   - Test the simulation by running `scripts/run_experiment.py` on this scenario and ensure events process correctly, even if dispatch logic is naive.

**Deliverables by End of Phase 2:**
- A functional simulation engine that can run a simple scenario end-to-end.
- Vehicles move and respond to events, and requests appear and are recorded, albeit with rudimentary logic.

---

## Phase 3: Demand Modeling & User Behavior Integration

**Objectives:**  
- Add dynamic demand generation and user behavior models.
- Integrate acceptance logic for users (e.g., simple logit model).

**Key Steps:**
1. **Demand Generation:**
   - In `drt_sim/demand/demand_generator.py`, implement a module that reads demand parameters from scenario config and schedules request-arrival events over time.
   - Add test cases to verify that demand patterns (e.g., Poisson arrival) generate requests as expected.

2. **User Behavior & Acceptance:**
   - Implement a basic logit-based user acceptance model in `drt_sim/algorithms/user_acceptance_models/logit_acceptance.py`.
   - Integrate user profiles in `user_profiles.py` and ensure the simulation checks acceptance before committing to pick-ups.

3. **Pre-Bookings & Patterns:**
   - Implement `prebooking_manager.py` to handle requests submitted in advance.
   - Validate with test scenarios that have both immediate and pre-booked requests.

**Deliverables by End of Phase 3:**
- Demand-driven requests appear in the simulation.
- User acceptance decisions influence whether requests convert into rides.
- Basic tests confirm functionality.

## Phase 4: Algorithms (Dispatch, Matching, Routing Enhancements)

**Objectives:**  
- Add a first set of dispatch and matching strategies.
- Allow scenario configurations to specify which algorithms to use.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Dispatch Algorithms:**
   - Implement a simple First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) dispatch strategy in `algorithms/dispatch/naive_dispatch.py`.
   - Integrate the dispatch algorithm selection via configuration in `config/parameters.py`.

2. **Matching Strategies:**
   - Implement a basic batch matching approach in `algorithms/matching/batch_matching.py`.
   - Ensure that the simulation periodically triggers matching events (e.g., every X simulated seconds) to match pending requests to vehicles.

3. **Routing Variants:**
   - Add time-dependent shortest path or genetic algorithm-based routing as a new routing module in `algorithms/routing/`.
   - Switch routing strategies via scenario configuration to demonstrate modularity.

4. **Cost Functions:**
   - Implement a simple cost function (e.g., travel time + wait time) in `algorithms/cost_functions/simple_cost.py`.

**Deliverables by End of Phase 4:**
- Multiple dispatch and routing algorithms that can be chosen from scenario configs.
- Confirm through scenario tests that changing dispatch or routing algorithms affects results as expected.

## Phase 5: Stop Selection & Network Adaptation

**Objectives:**  
- Introduce virtual stops and adaptive stop placement.
- Incorporate logic to handle network disruptions.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Stop Selection:**
   - In `stops/stop_selector.py`, implement a method to generate or select stops based on scenario parameters.
   - Optionally, integrate clustering algorithms for virtual stop placement.

2. **Adaptive Network Components:**
   - Implement `disruptions.py` to simulate link closures or delays.
   - Test adaptive routing (if scenario configured) to confirm vehicles reroute or stops shift.

**Deliverables by End of Phase 5:**
- System handles dynamic stop configurations.
- Disruptions reflect in routing decisions and affect simulation outcomes.

---

## Phase 6: Analysis & Visualization Tools

**Objectives:**  
- Implement analysis modules to collect metrics, generate plots, and compare scenarios.
- Enhance reproducibility and reporting.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Metrics & Analysis:**
   - In `analysis/metrics_collection.py`, record user wait times, in-vehicle times, vehicle utilization, etc.
   - Implement `analysis/statistics.py` to compute averages, confidence intervals, and perform statistical comparisons between runs.

2. **Visualization:**
   - In `analysis/visualization.py`, implement functions to create maps, time-series charts, or route animations.
   - Test by generating output plots for simple scenarios.

3. **Scenario Comparison:**
   - `analysis/scenario_comparison.py` to compare multiple scenario runs and highlight differences in KPIs.

**Deliverables by End of Phase 6:**
- A set of scripts and modules that can produce comprehensive reports and visuals.
- Validated output on test scenarios.

---

## Phase 7: Experiment Management & Reproducibility

**Objectives:**  
- Finalize experiment management tools.
- Ensure parameter sweeps, batch experiments, and reproducible runs are straightforward.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Parameter Sweeps & Batch Runs:**
   - Implement `experiments/parameter_sweeps.py` and `experiments/batch_runner.py` to run multiple scenarios automatically.
   - Integrate logging of random seeds and configuration snapshots for reproducibility.

2. **Documentation & Guides:**

# Updating the Blueprint as the System Evolves

As you build out the system, the blueprint should evolve to reflect new capabilities, changes in architecture, and lessons learned. A consistent approach will ensure that ChatGPT (or similar AI assistants) can stay aligned with the current state of the system:

1. **Maintain a Single Source of Truth for the Blueprint:**  
   Keep the blueprint in a version-controlled document (e.g., `docs/design_overviews/system_blueprint.md`). This file should always represent the *current* state of the system.

2. **Versioning the Blueprint:**  
   - Add a version number or date-stamp at the top of the blueprint.
   - Each time significant changes are made to the architecture, increment the version and briefly summarize changes in a “Change History” section at the end of the blueprint.

3. **Modular Sections:**  
   Break the blueprint into logical sections mirroring the directory structure and functionalities:
   - Core Simulation
   - Demand & User Behavior
   - Algorithms (Dispatch, Routing, Matching, Cost Functions)
   - Network & Stops
   - Analysis & Visualization
   - Experiments & Reproducibility
   - Integration & Extensions

   When updating, modify only the relevant sections and note these modifications in the Change History.

4. **Adding Context for AI Assistants:**  
   When providing the blueprint to an AI assistant like ChatGPT:
   - Paste the entire updated blueprint into the session, or host it in a repository and provide a link.
   - Clearly state which version of the blueprint you are currently using (e.g., “We are now on version 1.3 of the blueprint”).
   - Summarize what has changed since the previous version (e.g., “We have added a new RL-based dispatch algorithm and updated the user acceptance model section to include ML-based predictions”).

5. **Incremental Updates:**  
   After implementing a new feature (e.g., adding a new routing algorithm):
   - Update the corresponding section in the blueprint (e.g., add `algorithms/routing/new_cool_routing.py` and describe its key parameters and interfaces).
   - Commit the updated blueprint to version control.
   - Next time you consult ChatGPT, provide the updated version and highlight the new or changed parts.

6. **Keep Documentation Aligned:**  
   Ensure `docs/guides/` and `docs/design_overviews/` stay consistent with the blueprint. The blueprint is the high-level reference; detailed guides should link back to relevant blueprint sections.

# Providing Context to AI Tools

To keep an AI chatbot like ChatGPT aligned with your evolving system:

1. **Session Initialization:**  
   At the start of an AI session, include a short introduction:  
   “We are working on a DRT Research Simulation Platform. Here is the current blueprint (Version 1.3). Key changes since last version: Added RL-based dispatch and refined user acceptance models.”

2. **Linking or Pasting the Blueprint:**  
   - Paste the full updated blueprint into the chat if possible (or attach a link to it).
   - If the blueprint is too large, provide a summarized version with references to the sections you want ChatGPT to focus on.

3. **Ask Specific Questions in Context:**  
   When asking the chatbot to help implement new features or fix issues, reference the blueprint sections explicitly:
   - “According to the `algorithms/dispatch/` section of the blueprint, we have a new RL-based dispatch. Could you help me write a test for it?”
   - “Referring to the updated user acceptance model described in `algorithms/user_acceptance_models/ml_acceptance.py`, how can I integrate it with scenario configurations?”

By always referencing the current version of the blueprint and highlighting recent changes, you ensure that ChatGPT interprets your queries in the correct architectural context.
