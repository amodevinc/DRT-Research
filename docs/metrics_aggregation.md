In your **Demand Responsive Transit (DRT) research**—where you're studying various **dispatch strategies, routing algorithms, and service configurations**—the levels of aggregation you'll use depend on your specific research questions. However, some aggregation patterns are standard and will likely be essential for deriving meaningful insights.

Here's a breakdown of what will **make sense to aggregate at each level** and how it will serve your research goals:

---

### **1. Aggregation at the Replication Level**

#### **Purpose:**
- **Control for randomness** in stochastic simulations.
- Ensure your results are not biased by outliers from a single simulation run.
- Validate consistency and robustness of your models.

#### **What to Aggregate:**
- **Service Metrics per Replication:**  
  - *Average request wait time*, *passenger wait time*, *ride time*, *number of rejected requests*.
  - *Vehicle utilization rates* or *idle time*.
  - *Stop-level metrics*, like average boarding/alighting time.

#### **When It Makes Sense:**
- **Initial Analysis:** To understand variability in performance across identical conditions.
- **Robustness Testing:** Ensuring that outcomes aren’t driven by a specific random seed or a rare event.

#### **Example Insight:**
- **"Across 10 replications of Scenario A, the average request wait time is consistent within ±5 seconds, suggesting stable system behavior."**

---

### **2. Aggregation at the Scenario Level**

#### **Purpose:**
- Compare different **configurations or operational strategies** under identical external conditions.
- Evaluate how specific **parameters (like fleet size or routing algorithms)** impact performance.

#### **What to Aggregate:**
- **Aggregate Across Replications:** Compute the mean and variance of key metrics like wait times, rejection rates, etc., **within a scenario**.
- **Scenario-Level Comparisons:** Compare how **Scenario A (10 vehicles)** performs against **Scenario B (20 vehicles)** or how **Algorithm X** compares to **Algorithm Y**.

#### **When It Makes Sense:**
- **Strategy Comparison:** When you're testing **different service configurations** (e.g., fixed stops vs. virtual stops).
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Understanding how sensitive your system is to certain variables (like demand density).

#### **Example Insight:**
- **"Scenario B with 20 vehicles reduced the average passenger wait time by 30% compared to Scenario A, but increased vehicle idle time by 15%."**

---

### **3. Aggregation at the Experiment Level**

#### **Purpose:**
- Evaluate **parameter sweeps** or **multi-scenario experiments** that test a range of configurations.
- Explore **trade-offs** between competing objectives (e.g., minimizing wait time vs. maximizing vehicle utilization).

#### **What to Aggregate:**
- **Cross-Scenario Aggregation:** Analyze performance trends across multiple scenarios within an experiment.
  - Example: Aggregating metrics across all scenarios testing **different fleet sizes**.
- **Response Surfaces:** If you're using **parameter sweeps**, you can visualize how metrics change with varying parameters (like fleet size or time windows).

#### **When It Makes Sense:**
- **Optimization Studies:** When identifying the **optimal set of parameters** that balance multiple objectives.
- **Algorithm Benchmarking:** Comparing the **performance of different algorithms** across a range of operating conditions.

#### **Example Insight:**
- **"Experiment results show diminishing returns in wait time reduction when fleet size exceeds 25 vehicles, while operational costs continue to rise."**

### **4. Aggregation at the Study Level**

#### **Purpose:**
- **High-level comparative analysis** across multiple experiments to identify **broad patterns** or validate **general hypotheses**.
- Synthesizing results for **publication** or **reporting**.

#### **What to Aggregate:**
- **Cross-Experiment Insights:** Compare how different experiments perform in broader contexts.
  - Example: Aggregating results from **urban vs. suburban** demand patterns or **peak vs. off-peak** simulations.
- **General Trends:** Identifying universal behaviors across different service models.

#### **When It Makes Sense:**
- **Final Synthesis:** When you're ready to generalize findings or draw conclusions from multiple experiments.
- **Comparative Research:** When comparing entirely different system designs or approaches.

#### **Example Insight:**
- **"Across all studies, dynamic stop allocation consistently reduces passenger wait times by 20% compared to fixed-route configurations, regardless of demand density."**

### **What Aggregation Levels Will You Use Most?**

For **DRT research**, the following aggregation levels will be your primary focus:

1. **Replication-Level Aggregation**  
   - To ensure **robustness** and **stability** of your results.
   - Necessary before comparing scenarios or experiments.

2. **Scenario-Level Aggregation**  
   - For **comparing service configurations**, **fleet sizes**, or **dispatch algorithms**.
   - Helps you understand **specific system behaviors**.

3. **Experiment-Level Aggregation**  
   - For **optimization** and **parameter tuning**.
   - Essential when conducting **parameter sweeps** or **sensitivity analyses**.

4. **Study-Level Aggregation**  
   - Useful at the end of your research when **synthesizing broader trends**.
   - Often applied when preparing results for **publication** or **cross-study comparisons**.

### **How This Will Influence Your Visualization Strategy**

To support this multi-level aggregation, your **visualization and reporting** should be flexible enough to drill down or roll up data based on the level of analysis.

#### **Visualization Examples:**

1. **Replication-Level:**
   - **Boxplots or violin plots** to show variability across replications for a scenario.
   - **Histograms** to visualize the distribution of wait times per replication.

2. **Scenario-Level:**
   - **Bar charts** comparing average wait times, ride times, or rejection rates across scenarios.
   - **Line graphs** to show trends in performance as specific parameters (like fleet size) vary.

3. **Experiment-Level:**
   - **Heatmaps** for parameter sweeps (e.g., showing how wait time varies with fleet size and request density).
   - **Trade-off curves** (e.g., plotting wait time vs. operational cost).

4. **Study-Level:**
   - **Summary dashboards** that aggregate key findings from multiple experiments.
   - **Comparative charts** showing general trends across different geographic areas or demand profiles.

### **Conclusion**

- **Primary Aggregation Levels:**  
  - **Replications** (for robustness)  
  - **Scenarios** (for comparing configurations)  
  - **Experiments** (for optimization and parameter tuning)

- **When to Aggregate Across All Levels:**  
  - When summarizing **final findings** or preparing for **publication**, you'll aggregate at the **study level** to identify broad trends.

- **Practical Focus:**  
  While you'll collect data at all levels, you'll likely **analyze most deeply at the scenario and experiment levels** to compare configurations and optimize system performance.

By focusing on these levels, you'll ensure that your research is both **methodologically sound** and **practically relevant**, offering insights that can improve real-world DRT systems.
