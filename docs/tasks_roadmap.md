     - Caching results for performance optimization.

6. **Demand Modeling**
   - Create `demand/demand_generator.py` for time-varying, event-driven user demand:
     - Support simple demand patterns (peak/off-peak periods).
     - Implement `user_profiles.py` for user segment definitions.

7. **Logging and Debugging**
   - Set up logging (`logging_config.py`) for simulation events and outputs.

   - Implement baseline routing methods in `algorithms/routing/`:
     - **Dijkstra** for shortest paths (`dijkstra_routing.py`).
     - **Time-dependent routing** with dynamic travel times.
     - Add hooks for later integration of ML or GA-based routing.

2. **Dispatch Strategies**
   - Create baseline dispatch policies in `algorithms/dispatch/`:
     - **Naive FCFS** (First Come, First Served).
     - **Batch matching** for grouping requests.
   - Implement hooks to integrate optimization algorithms (e.g., Genetic Algorithms).

3. **Matching and Cost Functions**
   - Implement matching logic in `algorithms/matching/`:
     - **Simple cost functions** (e.g., wait time, detour minimization).
   - Set up flexible, multi-objective cost functions in `cost_functions/`.

4. **Stop Selection**
   - Develop `stops/stop_selector.py` for virtual stop selection:
     - Cost-based selection.
     - Grid-based spatial querying using **H3**.
   - Add **stop scoring** (safety, accessibility) in `stop_scoring.py`.

5. **User Acceptance Models**
   - Implement simple **logit-based acceptance** models in `algorithms/user_acceptance_models/logit_acceptance.py`.
   - Add hooks for ML-based user acceptance models.

1. **Scenario Management**
   - Add a **scenario repository** (`experiments/scenario_repository.py`) to store reusable configurations.

2. **Parameter Sweeps**
   - Implement `parameter_sweeps.py` for systematic experimentation with:
     - Fleet sizes, stop configurations, and dispatch parameters.

3. **Batch Experiment Runner**
   - Develop `batch_runner.py` to automate multiple simulation runs.

     - Generate **interactive maps** (Folium) showing vehicle routes and stops.
     - Create **demand heatmaps** and time-series charts (Matplotlib/Plotly).
     - Animate vehicle movement for visual debugging.

2. **Statistical Analysis**

     - Compare scenarios statistically (e.g., T-tests).
     - Generate key performance metrics (wait times, utilization).

3. **Scenario Comparison Tools**
   - Add `scenario_comparison.py` for automated result analysis and comparative charts.

     - **Event scheduling** logic.
     - **Routing algorithms**.
     - **Demand generation**.
